# Write Up Alien Cradle

Not really a Write Up required for that challenge, but whatever.

1. Open the file... everything is formated in one line -> So do proper formatting by replacing all the `;` with `;\n`.
2. Now you should already see the Flag splitted up in a few sub strings. Just replace all the `' + '` characters with an empty space.
3. You should have your flag `HTB{p0w3rsh3ll_Cr4dl3s_c4n_g3t_th3_j0b_d0n3}`
