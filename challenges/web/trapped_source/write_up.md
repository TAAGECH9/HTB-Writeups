# Write-Up: Trapped Source

Super easy challenge. Actually not really worth writting a write up. But you can solve the challenge by:

1. Open the ip:port with your browser
2. Investigate the Code with the Devtools and try to figure out the js code that is used when triggering Enter
3. You will find a comparison with the corresponding code
4. Enter the code... and you are done.
